# Changelog

## 2022-08-05 v1.4.2 -> v1.5.0

Previous functionality of _fetch.one():
* Retry any non-successful http response code
* Always delay 1000ms before retrying
* No ability to customise this behaviour

New functionality of _fetch.one();
* Default behaviour: Retry only http response codes >=500 and 429. Requests that return 500 have static delay of 1000ms, and requests that return 429 have delay with exponential backoff (1000ms, 2000ms, 4000ms etc).
* Abilty to customise the default behaviour by passing _fetch.one() new parameters: 
    * retryDelay (a function returning a number, or a static number) 
    * retryOn (a function returning true or false)

_fetch.many() followed the same behaviour for each request as _fetch.one(). The above changes to _fetch.one() apply to requests made with _fetch.many() as well:
* Default behaviour as for _fetch.one()
* Each individual request (in array of requests) accepts the new parameters retryDelay and retryOn to vary default behaviour.

Note that v1.4.3 and 1.4.4 accidentally had partially written features from 1.5.0, please do not use 1.4.3 and 1.4.4
